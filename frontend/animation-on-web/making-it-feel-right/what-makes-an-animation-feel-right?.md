## Animation feels right when it's natural, like a living organism

Linear animation can be unnatural, robotic.
Easing types can make animations feel more natural.

We can say that an animation feels right when it feels natural. The UI is then predictable and more delightful to use. Robotic animations are unnatural as almost nothing in the world around us moves at a constant speed.

This natural motion makes things easier to understand and is a major reason why mobile apps often feel better than web apps. Changes in web apps often occur instantly, which can make the experience feel artificial and unfamiliar, since nothing in the real world disappears or appears instantly.

## Animations should have a meaning

The fact that motion helps make the experience feel better doesn't mean that we have to animate everything on the screen. In order for an animation to feel right it also has to have a meaning. It should link actions to consequences in a logical and understandable way.

Not only do we get something that arguably looks pretty nice, but there's also a clear relationship between those two states.

Or a menu animation that I implemented at Vercel. We are translating the elements out and into the view. The animations are also direction-aware, meaning that if we hover on an element on the right, the new items will enter from the right, and old items will exit to the left, making the UI feel more intuitive
