It's super shameful that I found myself frustrated only focusing on my own productivity or my own performance.
I want to boost not only my productivity but also my team's productivity.
I want to be able to prioritize my team's priorities, not my own.

There are two kinds of things I can do

1. Make my team's work more efficient
2. Make my team people happier

### 1. Make my team's work more efficient

Find something that can be automated, faster, more accurate, or easier.

#### 1.1. Automate

#### 1.2. Faster

#### 1.3. More accurate

#### 1.4. Easier

### 2. Make my team people happier

- Care how all others feel. Are they happy? Not? and why? What can I do to make them happy?
-

### 3. Communicate better

- When I say something, I better clarify briefly why I want to say something. (ex. I just want to make sure xx,... or I just want to share my opinion, ...)
