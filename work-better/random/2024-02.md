I want to boost not only my productivity but also my team's productivity.
I want to be able to prioritize my team's priorities, not my own.

There are two kinds of things I can do

1. Make my team's work more efficient
2. Make my team people happier

### 1. Make my team's work more efficient

Find something that can be automated, faster, more accurate, or easier.
