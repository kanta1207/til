It's super shameful that I found myself frustrated only focusing on my own productivity or my own performance.
I want to boost not only my productivity but also my team's productivity.
I want to be able to prioritize my team's priorities, not my own.

There are two kinds of things I can do

1. Make my team's work more efficient
2. Make my team people happier

### 1. Make my team's work more efficient

Find something that can be automated, faster, more accurate, or easier.

#### 1.1. Automate

#### 1.2. Faster

#### 1.3. More accurate

#### 1.4. Easier

### 2. Make my team people happier

- Care how all others feel. Are they happy? Not? and why? What can I do to make them happy?
-

### 3. Communicate better

- When I say something, I better clarify briefly why I want to say something. (ex. I just want to make sure xx,... or I just want to share my opinion, ...)

### Write better documentations or comments

#### Don't write unnecessary documentation or comments

- Can be waste of time for both writer and the reviewer to read the documentation or comments, making sure they are correct and up to date
- Can easily be outdated and there's no way to automatically keep it up to date

#### Then how to write good documentation?

- Rather than writing all of the contents by yourself, write minimum sentences and leave well-written official documentations, articles or reading source from the web, and link them.
  - The documentation can be more accurate and up to date, or if it's outdated, still there's low risk because you didn't put too much effort into it
- ADR (Architecture Decision Record) can be a exception because it'll be valuable even if it's outdated.
- Documentations for coding style or PR styles are waste of time, instead make a rule with eslint or commit lint and enforce it.

**You write documentations or comments as last resort. Try to find other ways to achieve what you want.(Automation, better code readability, etc)**

### Be better as a onboarder(newcomer)

- From day1, try to find any room for improvement
- At least you can try to make the onboarding process better.
